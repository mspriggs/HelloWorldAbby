<h1> Hello World </h1>
<p>HTML is one of the most used ways to create a web page. It works with your browser to tell it what to display as you code it. HTML helps create headings, paragraphs, and links for pages. </p>

<p>I chose to take this class because I have always been very interested in how the web pages we see and use every day were designed. In the future I would like to possibly have my own business and with that comes an online page, and it would be cool to be able to design it myself. Both of these things are the reasons I chose to take this class.</p>
